> `teraflops` - a terraform ops tool which is sure to be a flop

`teraflops` aims to provide an integrated experience for deployment workflows which involve both [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) and [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos) - similar to that of [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops). `teraflops` uses the excellent [colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena) deployment tool to do most of the heavy lifting, so the following example should look somewhat familiar if you have ever used `colmena`.

```
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    teraflops.url = "github:aanderse/teraflops";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, teraflops, ... }: {
    teraflops = {
      imports = [ teraflops.modules.hcloud ];

      meta = {
        nixpkgs = import nixpkgs {
          system = "x86_64-linux";
        };
      };

      machine = { pkgs, ... }: {
        deployment.targetEnv = "hcloud";
        deployment.hcloud = {
          server_type = "cx11";
          location = "nbg1";
        };

        environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.htop ];
      };

      # if desired you can write terraform code directly inside your teraflops modules
      terraform = {
        backend.s3 = {
          bucket = "mybucket";
          key = "path/to/my/key";
          region = "us-east-1";
        };
      };
    };
  }
}
```

## Usage

The `teraflops` tool has a number of high level commands that often resemble the `NixOps` CLI.

```
# prepare your terraform state in the current working directory
teraflops init

# applies all terraform state and deploys your NixOS configuration
teraflops deploy --reboot --confirm

# perform some operational commands
teraflops ssh-for-each -- df -h
teraflops scp machine:/root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub .

# NixOS introspection
teraflops repl
teraflops eval '{ nodes, ... }: builtins.attrNames nodes'
```

Additionally there are two low level subcommands which get out of your way and let you use the tools you're used to: `terraform` and `colmena`.

```
# 'teraflops tf' is a direct passthrough to terraform
teraflops tf init
teraflops tf apply

# 'teraflops nix' is a direct passthrough to colmena
teraflops nix repl
teraflops nix apply --reboot
```

## Deployment arguments

`terapflops` implements the `set-args` command from [NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops/blob/master/doc/overview.rst#network-arguments). Referencing the example from `NixOps`:

```
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    teraflops.url = "github:aanderse/teraflops";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, teraflops, ... }: {
    teraflops =
      { maintenance ? false }:
      {
        machine =
          { config, pkgs, ... }:
          { services.httpd.enable = maintenance;
            ...
          };
      };
  };
}
```

You can pass deployment arguments using the `set-args` command. For example, if we want to set the `maintenance` argument to `true` in the previous example, you can run:

```
teraflops set-args --arg maintenance true
```

## Special arguments

In addition to the regular `nix` module inputs and those defined by calls to the `set-args` command the following arguments are available to `teraflops` modules:

- `outputs`: The fully evaluated [terraform output values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs). Generally these aren't as useful in `teraflops` as they are in `terraform` because the `teraflops eval` command has full access to a `resources` argument which accounts for _most_ use cases in `terraform`.
- `resources`: The fully evaluated `terraform` resource set, which includes `resource`, `data`, `module`, etc... objects representing the full state of your deployment.
- `tf`: A minor helper which is most useful for the `tf.ref` function it contains which is used to create `terraform` references, just like in [terranix](https://terranix.org/news/2023-05-24_release-2.6.0.html).

_NOTE:_ Both `outputs` and `resources` will be `null` when a `teraflops` module is evaluated for the purpose of generating `terraform` code in order to avoid recursion.

## Implementation

A very quick `python` script I hacked together which isn't great. Don't look at the code yet... really ðŸ˜…
